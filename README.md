# Spaceship
Yalu Space but with a cooler name and icon.
Seriously, it's the same as the one from https://github.com/jakeajames/yalu102-space but with a cooler name and icon.
## Changelog ##
* Initial Commit  
  * Changed same icon files that I used in my own version of Yalu
  * Changed name
* Second Commit
  * I pulled the IPA because I didn't switch out the icons properly for the App Switcher. Then I realized that I'm too lazy to fix this minor detail right now. So the IPA is still the same as the original commit.
